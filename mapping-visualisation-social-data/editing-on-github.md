- Click on the pencil icon **Edit this file** in the top left corner: ![](images/github-edit.png)

- Make your changes *the website is written in Quarto - it should be fairly easy to read!*

- Click **Commit changes...** ![](images/github-commit-changes.png)

- By default, you will be asked to **Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request**. 

- Type in a little note explaining what you have changed and click **Propose changes**. ![](images/github-propose-changes.png)
